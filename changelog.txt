Added (client side) Highscore tracking.
Added Restart capabilties and proper "Start" handling (player can no longer start more than one game at the same time).
Fixed issue with Error SFX  not playing, now it plays whenever you click on an incorrect color or empty space.
Fixed issue with bugs not being spawned as frequent, this was caused because the spawn are goes beyond the height of the screen.

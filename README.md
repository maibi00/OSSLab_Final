# OSSLab Final Project 2021-1

## What is the purpose of this project?
This is a simple mouse accuracy minigame created entirely in HTML.
Everyone is on the computer a lot, especially nowadays. I personally suffer from pretty poor mouse accuracy even in daily use computing
So I made this little game to hopefully improve that.

## Instructions
- You are the square in the center. Your job is to click on squares as they appear.
- Your click only counts if:
	* Your square matches the color of the square that is clicked.
	* You click within the square.
- Use the Q, W, E and R keys to change the color of the square according to the legend ingame.
- You have 60 seconds to click as many squares as you can. Good luck!

## To play
1. Clone the repo
2. Launch index.html in your browser of choice.
3. That's it!
